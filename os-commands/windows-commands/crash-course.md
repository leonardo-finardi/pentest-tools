netstat - This command is used to display active network connections, listening ports, and other network-related statistics. This can be useful for identifying suspicious network activity and potential security threats.

ipconfig - This command displays the current configuration of the network interface cards (NICs) on the system. It can be used to identify IP addresses, default gateway, DNS servers, and other network information.

tracert - This command is used to trace the route that packets take to reach a destination. This can be useful for identifying the location of network devices and potential network bottlenecks.

ping - This command sends ICMP echo requests to a specified host to test network connectivity. It can be used to identify if a host is online or offline and to measure response time.

nslookup - This command is used to query DNS servers for information about a specific domain name. It can be useful for identifying the IP address of a web server and verifying DNS resolution.

route - This command displays the routing table for the system. It can be used to identify the default gateway and any static routes that are configured.

arp - This command displays the current ARP cache for the system. It can be used to identify the MAC address of a network device.

net - This command is used to manage network resources, such as shares and users. It can be used to gather information about network resources and potentially exploit misconfigured shares.

tasklist - This command displays a list of running processes on the system. It can be used to identify potentially malicious processes or ones that are consuming a lot of system resources.

netstat -ano - This command is similar to netstat, but it also displays the process ID (PID) associated with each network connection. This can be useful for identifying which processes are communicating over the network.

taskkill - This command is used to terminate a running process. It can be useful for stopping malicious processes that are running on the system.

reg - This command is used to manage the Windows registry. It can be used to modify registry keys and values, which can potentially be used to bypass security controls or escalate privileges.

whoami - This command displays the current user context of the command prompt. It can be useful for verifying which user account is currently logged in and has permissions to access certain files or folders.

net user - This command is used to manage user accounts on the system. It can be used to add new users, reset passwords, or modify user permissions.

net localgroup - This command is used to manage local groups on the system. It can be used to add new groups or add/remove users from existing groups.

net view - This command is used to display a list of computers and shared resources on the network. It can be useful for identifying potential targets for exploitation.

netstat -b - This command is similar to netstat -ano, but it also displays the executable file associated with each network connection. This can be useful for identifying which processes are communicating over the network and potentially identifying malicious processes.

systeminfo - This command displays detailed system information, including the operating system version, hardware specifications, and installed software. It can be useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities or outdated software versions.

sc - This command is used to manage Windows services. It can be used to start, stop, or modify the configuration of services running on the system.

cipher - This command is used to manage the encryption of files and folders on the system. It can be used to encrypt or decrypt files, and to identify potentially sensitive files that are not encrypted.
